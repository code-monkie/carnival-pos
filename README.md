# Carnival POS 

Internal coding challenge for developers at RSI. This coding challenge asked us to develop a system to help a carnival food booth manage orders. Included in assets is the original assignment and my deck describing what I wanted to focus on during the assignment. 

This project lasted 3 weeks, with development taking part after hours.
